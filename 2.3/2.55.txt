Exercise 2.55.  Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

(car ''abracadabra)

To her surprise, the interpreter prints back quote. Explain.

(car ''abracadabra) is the same as:
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))

quote is a special form with normal-order evaluation, so the outer quote won't cause the inner quote to be evaluated.
