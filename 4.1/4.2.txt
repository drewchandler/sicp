a. The cond relies on application being last, because the application? predicate
just checks for a pair which a lot of the expressions in our system are
represented as. If you move it up it will think the the tag on tagged lists is
an operator and try to apply that tag.

b.
(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cdar exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
